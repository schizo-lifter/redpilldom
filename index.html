      <h2>Road to political/philosophical redpilldom</h2>
      <p>Alright, I suppose since all you cunts can understand English well enough, you don‚Äôt have to wait for me to drag my slow AF ass Viet-subtitiling aproximately two hundred ‚Äúred-pill‚Äù videos (Still not enough tho. and I‚Äôm at about what? 30?) to spoon-fed you like the plebs, so I‚Äôm just going to point you to what you shoud look up, and where, and in which order, to be ‚Äúpolitically red-pilled‚Äù. Do follow the order so as not to give yourself anaphylactic shock from red-overdosing. EDIT: And I repeat: <span class="emphasize">"DO FOLLOW THE ORDER"</span></p>
      <p>‚ÄúHistory? Philosophy? But OPpppppp, it‚Äôs booooooring! Can we skip strait to something more modern? Or something about sexuality and self-improvement?‚Äù - some of you might say,</p>
      <p>And to that, I say: Shut. Most of the VNmese version of ‚ÄúThe Red Pill as a Sexual Strategy‚Äù that most of you have known up to this point have been nothing but fucking ancient knowledge, which people have mastered and practiced FOR LITERAL AEONS. You can go back to simping PUAs if you can‚Äôt connect the dots any further and that‚Äôs all that your monkey brain is capable of. Scratch that. Go back and join the blue-pilled mass you nitwit.</p>
    </section>

    <article>
      <p class="title">1) Antiquity/Greco-Roman era stuffs:</p>
      <p>- (optional)Look up Plato‚Äôs ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù. Read it. Or watch a summary video, or whatever. I don‚Äôt care. (You can do the same with the next ones I‚Äôm going to mention here.) Not because there's something good to learn from it, but just to understand that it has a deceptive name, it‚Äôs wack, and the horrendous shits we see now, just as when Rome fell, are sort of Plato's fault. You‚Äôll know why later on.</p>
      <p>- Look up Aristotle stuffs. Only ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù is available on shelves in VN rite now, but you should also look up ‚ÄúNichomachean Ethics‚Äù and ‚ÄúOrganon‚Äù (he was THIS üëå close to discovering science, or more precisely, the scientific method). Edit: Nichomachean Ethics is now available in VNmese</p>
      <p>- Cicero‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn Government‚Äù. One could say that he was a big inspiration for Enlightenment thinkers and the US founding fathers.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this part is to understand why Western institutions and governments back then were set up the way they were, the origin of the mind vs. body split (Plato vs. Aristotle), the origin of logic and science, and the wisdom and legacy these ancient Western civs left for all of us.</p>
    </article>

    <div class="line_break">
    </div>

    <article>
      <p class="title">2) Renaissance/Age of Enlightenment/Classical Liberalism era stuffs:</p>
      <p>- Machiavelli‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Prince‚Äù (self-explanatory), and ‚ÄúDiscourse‚Äù (Or why The Prince and its author aren't as evil as you think they are, but you probably already know that)</p>
      <p>- Francis Bacon‚Äôs ‚ÄúNovum Organum‚Äù. The origin of Empiricism, of the scientific method, the method of discovering truth that actually works (vs all others that resulted in myths and mysticism of some kind and might as well be fiction literatures).</p>
      <p>- All works you can find from the Anglosphere‚Äôs side of the Enlightenment: from Hobbes, Hume, Locke, Smith‚Ä¶ to Americans like Paine, Tocqueville and the U.S' Founding Fathers.</p>
      <p>- On the continental side, read Montesquieu‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpirit of Law‚Äù and Bastiat‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Law‚Äù, and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it. Others like Rousseau are mostly wack, and they set up the foundation for the next era‚Äôs batch of wackjobs (I mean, ‚Ä¶ just look at the result of the French Revolution and compare it to the American counter-part).</p>
      <p>The purpose of this part is to understand what the scientific method is, what science is vs. what most people think it is (and why not just any reasonable-ish sounding mumbo jumbo can be science/can be used to discover truth), understand how modern Economics was born, and why the current Western governments are set up the way they are.</p>

    <article>
      <p class="title">3) Counter Enlightenment era/19th Century Libertarianism stuffs:
      <p>‚ÄúNot scientific, but not incorrect‚Äù is the theme of the previous era and this era, because that‚Äôs what you get when advancements in science and tech aren‚Äôt quite there yet and everyone kind of have to make do with rational guesses/thought experiments/mental simulations (‚Äúa priori‚Äù if you want the correct term). The thing with ‚Äúrational guesses‚Äù is that, sometimes, they got it right, or somewhat right, and got vindicated later on, but that‚Äôs not always the case. So, look up:</p>
      <p>- Nietzsche and Jung: This one is quite obvious. Freud made many wrong guesses and created pseudo-psychology.</p>
      <p>- Austrian School of Economic: study the likes of Menger, Bawerk, Wiser and their economic theories. Many concepts of Modern Economics was produced by the Austrian, but they hardly get a mention even in books for Econ major students anymore, and you‚Äôll know why later on. And assuming y‚Äôall have been taught Marxism at school, this is the first step in rejecting the economics aspect of that blue-pilled shit.</p>
      <p>- Darwin‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrigin of species‚Äù: ‚ÄúWait. Something that is actually scientific?‚Äù- Yes. It will be VERY useful later. (Ignore the deniers. They are invested into/committed to the sunk cost fallacy for their equalitarian faith or ideology, and could only criticize without offering any scientific alternative explanations other than myth and mysticism. In other words, they want to bait you into moral hazards with false promises)</p>

    <article>
      <p class="title">4) Modern (finally) stuffs</p>
      <p>a) Philosophy <br>
      - Karl Popper: Finally, after a century of shit, an actually good philosopher? Who reformed rationalism and pushed the scientific method even further? Wha‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>b) Austrian school part 2, Libertarianism and Anarcho Capitalism: Mises, Hayek, Schumpeter, Rothbard, and Hoppe. <br>
      -Read Hoppe's argument for monarchism, as it'll be useful later on. EDIT: Skip Rothbard for less mumbo jumbo headache.</p>
      <p>Side note: It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that Anarcho Capitalism is takes Classical Liberalism/Libertarianism arguments and push it to its logical conclusion, effectively the most extreme this line of thoughts can reach‚Ä¶ buuut it‚Äôs still just rational guesses after rational guesses, and again, only somewhat correct. And since they‚Äôve been playing the guessing game for so long, they are completely oblivious to the development of science in fields related to human behaviours, and the further you go, the more thought-experimental and unscientific this ideology become. Hayek tried to course-correct in the first half of the 20th century and Hoppe in the second half and early 21st, but Liberarianism and the Austrians ultimately failed to gain any kind of relevancy outside of their little circle. Also, there's no such thing as a "priori science". We no longer live in late 19th/early 20th century when we still have to guess how human would behave and why they behave the way they do. We can measure and explain that shit scientifically now (neuroscience & evolutionary psychology to name a few). You'll see it once you've reach the stage mentioned at the end of this post.
      </p>
      <p>At the end of this stage you should already have all aspects of Marxist Economics ejected out of your system.</p>
      <p>c) Understanding the ‚Äúcurrent year‚Äù situation/The road to right-wing politics.</p>
      <p>First, look up these Youtubers:</p>
      <p>- Styxhexenhamer666: This guys should be the go to guy in discussing and analyzing anything US political news, because he's really good at it. He was one of the first to predict Trump would win in 2016. But remember, do not dabbled in following and discussing events for too long.</p>
      <p>- Sargon of Akkad: Start with his ‚ÄúIlliberal Progressive‚Äù and ‚ÄúLiberal Ideas‚Äù series. Then watch his #Brexit series, then ‚ÄúA tale of 2 narratives‚Äù. Other than those, watch whatever you want. Again, it‚Äôs good to know the current situation, but don‚Äôt get stuck in following and discussing events. ‚ÄúThe politics of Starship Trooper‚Äù is a must watch, tho.</p>
      <p>- Computing Forever/Dave Cullen Show: He‚Äôs like Irish Sargon, but more right/conservative leaning and he discuss ideas more often than Sargon.</p>
      <p>- Academic agent: He focuses exclusively on the economic aspect of things. Heavily leans towards discussing ideas.</p>
      <p>- PragerU: All of their videos are worth a watch, except ones about the Jews, Israel, Fascism, and Evolution Theory. Do pay attention to their bias towards a certain group of religions.</p>
      <p>- Black Pigeon Speaks: You probably know him already. The pill really starts to get red at this one.</p>
      <p>Second, start looking into different conspiracy theories (some should really be called "hypotheses"). Heck, you should start by looking into the origin of the term "conspiracy theory" itself. The banking cartel, Zionism, the Rothschild, the Jews, Q-Anon, etc... Look into them. But remember: 1) to apply all that you've learnt before this stage, and approach them with a skeptical and rational mind. 2) do realize that this too, is another form of events discussing and focusing on it exclusively can be detrimental to yourself. A grain of truth semblance in a sea of noises and paranoia just isn't worth it most of the time. Just try to understand what the enemy have done and is capable of.</p>
      <p>At the end of this stage, you should have become aware of what the current situation of the world that we inherited is. Oh, and, uh... Don't get black-pilled with all the conspiracies.</p>
      <p>d) Neoreactionary/Dark Enlightenment/F a s c i s m</p>
      <p>This where the ‚Äúthe red pill‚Äù in its current form was born. You should look up what ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù actually means, and unlearn whatever definition that you‚Äôve been taught in VN.</p>
      <p>- Human Bio-diversity: Here you are going to have to re-study the modern, updated version of the Theory of Evolution that you were taught by digging up your highschool biology textbooks, and compare and contrast it with Darwin's. Then, look up blogs about HBD like Jayman, HBD Chick, Spandrell, Steve Sailer... or just read everything here: <a class="link" href="http://www.humanbiologicaldiversity.com/" target="_blank">humanbiologicaldiversity</a> . This where many of the previous eras' ‚Äúrational guesses‚Äù (whether right or wrong) begins to clash with reality, or more specifically, biology.</p>
      <p>- F a s c i s m: At this point, you should have already realized this 1 thing - never, NEVER, learn about an ideology exclusively from the words of its enemies. Fascism is, let's just say, an ideology of many correct rational guesses. But because of the war, it is now a taboo (sounds familiar?). So: Read Spengler, Evola. Watch Asha Logos, Way of The World, Normapollo, Cultured Thug on Bitchute, and VertigoPolitix on‚Ä¶ wherever his videos are archived (YouTube, Bitchute, Archive.org‚Ä¶). Understand what it really was/is, what its adherents tried to achieved, what it/they tried to solve and got correct (and not what the mainstream academia and media tried to paint it/them to be). But just like with "conspiracy theories", do use a skeptical and rational mind, and realize what they did wrong, not just in term of the historical choices they made, but also, their models for society, politics and economics.</p>
      <p>- Neoreactionary: An offshoot from Hoppe's libertarianism (see the AnCap part above) where "the red pill" in its current form was born. Look up Mencius Moldbug and his blog, ‚ÄúUnqualified Reservation‚Äù (Or watch The Distributist‚Äôs ‚ÄúGentle intro to Moldbug‚Äù, Charlemagne's "Mulling on Moldbug" on YouTube), Nick Land and his blog, ‚ÄúThe Dark Enlightenment‚Äù. Understand concepts like ‚ÄúCthulhu always swim left‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Cathedral‚Äù, the ‚Äútrichotomy‚Äù, accelerationism‚Ä¶ EDIT: Auron MacIntyre is also a must-watch YouTube channel</p>
      <p>At the end of this stage, among other things, you should have an understanding of why and how the world is in the situation that it is, the people who are truly responsible ‚Äì a long line of pseudoscientists starting with Freud (some would argue that it started with Rousseau or even all the way back with Plato) and their funders, and all the short-comings of the previous era‚Äôs ideas, rejecting all aspects of Marxism as well as the lie of equality. And if you're smart enough, the path forwards should finally beginning to take shape...</p>
      <p>e) Propertarianism.</p>
      <p>At last, you‚Äôve reach where I am at now. The pinnacle. The culmination of everything you have learnt thus far, every discoveries, every correct guesses - the strategy that have made those discoveries and correct guesses possible, the strategy that have made the West more successful than the rest, from the Indo-European steppe people, to the Greek and Roman, to the Germanic and English civilizations, dragging mankind kicking and screaming out of the darkness of time, poverty, diseases, superstitions, ignorances,... all synthesized and written down - Propertarianism.</p>
      <p>Go watch John Mark‚Äôs videos here <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/John_Mark_Archive" target="_blank">John-Mark-Archive</a></p>
      <p>I‚Äôll upload In Truth Victorious' deleted videos some day. EDIT: It's now online: <a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/In-Truth-Victorious-Propertarianism-Explains" target="_blank">In-Truth-Victorious-Propertarianism-Explains</a></p>
      <p>But most importantly, start reading CurtDoolittle's work at the Institute: <a class="link" href="https://propertarianinstitute.com" target="_blank">Propertarianinstitute</a></p>
      <p>This strategy at the moment can be applied most effectively to the Western world and the people of European descent, but should any other human group wishes to achieve the same level of success can adopt it and adapt to it. You know what that means, right?</p>
